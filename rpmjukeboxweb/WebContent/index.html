			<h1>RPM Jukebox</h1>
			<p>
				Long ago in a galaxy far, far away there existed a Flash based Jukebox hosting all the songs submitted to
				the <a href="http://www.rpmchallenge.com">RPM Challenge</a> up until that point. It made it possible to 
				take a random journey through the body of collected work and store any favourites in a playlist. Unfortunately 
				it was buggy and the original maintainer stopped work on it, so it was pulled and we are left with the browser 
				based version we have today - which while functional, does not provide the same means to discover the great 
				music hidden beneath. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So with that in mind, I've taken it upon myself to restore the same kind of easy access in a 
				new RPM Jukebox...

			<div class="download">
				<a href="./releases/rpm-jukebox-2.0.3.dmg"><img src="./images/download-mac.png"/></a>
				<a href="./releases/rpm-jukebox-2.0.3.exe"><img src="./images/download-windows.png"/></a>
				<a onClick="toggleLinuxDownload();"><img class="pointer" src="./images/download-linux.png"/></a>
			</div>
			<div class="linux" id="linux-download">
				<a href="./releases/rpm-jukebox-2.0.3.deb">.deb (Ubuntu, Mint etc)</a>
				<a href="./releases/rpm-jukebox-2.0.3.rpm">.rpm (Fedora etc)</a>
				<a href="./releases/rpm-jukebox-2.0.3.tar.gz">.tar.gz (Manual install)</a>
			</div>
			<p>
				Functionality includes:-
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Search over all currently available tracks hosted on the RPM Challenge site</li>
				<li>The ability to mark a track as a favourite and for it to appear in the favourites playlist</li>
				<li>Create custom playlists and import/export them for sharing</li>
				<li>Play a random selection of songs from the RPM catalogue</li>
				<li>Display of album/artist images where available (I think most images prior to 2016 have been lost to the ether)</li>
				<li>File caching to take the load off the RPM servers</li>
				<li>Shuffle/repeat play</li>
				<li>Graphic equalizer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Source code available on <a href="https://github.com/mpcontracting/rpmjukebox">GitHub</a> - pull requests welcome.
				Please report any issues you discover on the <a href="https://github.com/mpcontracting/rpmjukebox/issues">GitHub issues page</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				On Windows you may see a firewall warning pop-up like the screenshot below. This is due to the way the file caching works and you can safely leave
				the jukebox blocked by hitting cancel, it doesn't need the external access, it's just Windows being dumb.
