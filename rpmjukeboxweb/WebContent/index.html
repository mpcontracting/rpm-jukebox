			<h1>RPM Jukebox</h1>
			<p>
				Long ago in a galaxy far, far away there existed a Flash based Jukebox hosting all the songs submitted to
				the RPM Challenge up until that point. It made it possible to take a random journey through the body
				of collected work and store any favourites in a playlist. Unfortunately it was buggy and the original
				maintainer stopped work on it, so it was pulled and we are left with the browser based version we have
				today - which while functional, does not provide the same means to discover the great music hidden
				beneath. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So with that in mind, I've taken it upon myself to restore the same kind of easy access in a 
				new RPM Jukebox...
			</p>
			<div class="center"><img src="./images/jukebox.png"/></div>
			<p>
				Current functionality includes:-
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Search over all currently available tracks hosted on the RPM Challenge site</li>
				<li>The ability to mark a track as a favourite and for it to appear in the favourites playlist</li>
				<li>Play a random selection of songs from the RPM catalogue</li>
				<li>Display of album/artist images where available (I think all images prior to 2016 have been lost to the ether)</li>
				<li>Shuffle/repeat play</li>
				<li>Graphic equalizer</li>
				<li>Mac OSX and Windows versions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In development:-
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom playlists and playlist export/sharing</li>
				<li>Linux version (currently having problems with no sound)</li>
			</ul>
